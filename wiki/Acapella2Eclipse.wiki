This page gives a brief overview about using [http://eclipse.org/ Eclipse] to devellope Acapella Code.

= Introduction =

It is easy to write and test Acapella Code with [http://eclipse.org/ Eclipse] a module to colorize your code has been developed for the [http://colorer.sourceforge.net/eclipsecolorer/index.html Eclipse Colorer plugin]. This will allow you to program in a nice IDE and leverage many functions not implemented in the Evoshell, such as SVN, spell checker, other programming resources etc.

1) Install [http://eclipse.org/ Eclipse]: http://eclipse.org/

2) Install the [http://colorer.sourceforge.net/eclipsecolorer/index.html Eclipse Colorer plugin]: http://colorer.sourceforge.net/eclipsecolorer/index.html For better functionallity install the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/colorer/files/Eclipse%20Colorer/EclipseColorer-take5_0.8.0/EclipseColorer-take5_0.8.0.zip/download version 0.8.0] of the plugin by unpacking content of the plugin's package into %ECLIPSEHOME%/plugins/

3) Edit the *%ECLIPSEHOME%/plugins/et.sf.colorer_X.X.X/colorer/catalog.xml* and add in the *{{{<hrc-sets>}}}* container the following line: <location link="hrc/acapella/acapellaLink.hrc"/>
4) Create a folder named acapella in: *%ECLIPSEHOME%/plugins/et.sf.colorer_X.X.X/colorer/hrc

5) Add to the newly created folder the content of: http://code.google.com/p/operahci/source/browse/#svn/Acapella/MiscTools/EclipseIntegration/trunk/EclipseColorer/acapella

6) Start Eclipse and open a .script, .param or .parameter file.
